- **TypeORM:**  An ORM for TypeScript and JavaScript (ES7, ES6, ES5), allowing for database management with PostgreSQL, making data modeling easier and more intuitive.
- **Passport.js:** Middleware for authentication in Node.js applications, supporting various authentication strategies, with a focus on JWT for secure API access.
- **Swagger:** A tool for documenting  API, enabling easy visualization and interaction with API endpoints directly from a browser.
- **Socket.IO :** A library for real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication, making it ideal for applications that require live updates, such as chat apps.

### 🎨 Frontend (React 19 RC / OBS: React 18 for the moment)

**🧙‍♂️👨‍💻 Upon it´s release I will be migrating this project to use React 19!**  

- **React 19 :** The latest upcoming version of the most popular front-end library, React, introducing several new features and improvements for building user interfaces. Some anticipated features include:
  - ***Server Components:*** Enhances server-side rendering by allowing you to build components that run exclusively on the server, reducing the need for client-side JavaScript.
  - ***Concurrent Rendering Improvements:*** Better handling of asynchronous tasks, making UIs more responsive by allowing React to interrupt rendering and continue later when needed.
  - ***Simplified State Management:*** Improvements in the way React handles state, making it more intuitive and reducing the complexity of managing state across components.
- **ShadcnUI Components & Tailwind CSS:** A powerful combination for styling and building UI components. ShadcnUI provides a set of highly customizable and accessible UI components using Tailwind syntax.
- **Axios:** Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests that simplifies the process of handling HTTP requests, supporting features like request and response interception, automatic JSON data transformation, and error handling.
